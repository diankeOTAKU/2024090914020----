      <h2>The great person I admire most</h2>
      <p>
      As authentic Chineses, rice is such an indispensable food that we tend to eat it every day.You can enjoy it until you're
      full anytime, as long as you're willing.But do you know who made us live such a happy life？</p>
      <p>Yes,the great person is Yuan Nongping. Known as the "Father of Hybrid Rice," he is a renowned Chinese agricultural
      scientist. Born in September 1930, he dedicated his life to the research and development of hybrid rice, aiming to
      alleviate food shortages globally.</p>
      <p>However, his great achievements were not always smooth sailing.With limited resources and scientific knowledge on hybrid
      crops, he had to rely on extensive experimentation.What's more,during the Cultural Revolution,he and his team's research
      findings had been almost completely destroyed.Nonetheless,he still keep going his.Fortunately, his perseverance finally led
      to the development of high-yield hybrid rice, revolutionizing agriculture.</p>
      <p>Today, whenever I eat rice, I always think of him.His spirit inspires me to think of others and persevere in the face of
      difficulties.I will honor him forever!</p>
